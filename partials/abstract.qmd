The thesis investigates the potential of two computational methods for analyzing biophysically accurate models of neurons or neural clusters: a relatively standard grid-based simulation approach and a continuation method based on novel methodologies. It covers the necessary theory of dynamical and semidynamical systems, delay differential equations, numerical integration, and one-dimensional optimization. Various physiological neuronal models are considered, each relating to a specific neuro-signal (spiking, bursting, etc.). An approach using a grid-based simulation of the coupled system for each parametric combination on the grid is introduced. It is then iteratively developed and improved. Afterward, a numerical continuation of the cycle manifold is discussed. This method based on the bifurcation theory of ODEs and DDEs is later applied to the studied problem. Finally, both approaches are compared from various perspectives.
