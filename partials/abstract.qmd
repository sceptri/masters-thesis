This thesis focuses on the computation of phase shift between two weakly coupled neuronal models with a possible delay in the coupling. The necessity and importance of such a study is fueled by the lack of understanding of high-frequency oscillations near epileptogenic zones. It covers the necessary theory of dynamical and semidynamical systems, delay differential equations, numerical integration, and one-dimensional optimization. A method based on a simulation of the coupled system for each parametric combination on the grid is introduced. It is then iteratively developed and improved. Afterward, a numerical continuation of the cycle manifold is discussed. This methodology based on the bifurcation theory of ODEs and DDEs is later applied to the studied problem. Finally, both methods are compared from various perspectives.
