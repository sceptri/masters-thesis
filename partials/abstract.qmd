In this we thesis, we focus on computation of phase shift between two weakly coupled oscillators with possible delay in the coupling. It covers necessary theory of (semi)dynamical systems, delay differential equations, numerical integration and 1D optimization. A method based on a simulation of the coupled system for each parametric combination on grid is introduced and iteratively developed and improved. Afterward, numerical continuation of cycle manifold based on bifurcation theory of both ODEs and DDEs is discussed, with the techniques applied to the studied problem. Finally, these two methods are compared from various perspectives.
