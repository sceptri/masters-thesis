First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor doc. RNDr. Lenka Přibylová, Ph.D., for her insightful comments, enthusiasm and last, but certainly not least, patience. Moreover, I wish to extend my gratitude to all members of the Nonlinear Dynamics Team, who played a key role throughout the work on this thesis. Crucially, I want to thank my partner Veronika for her endless patience and affection, we she has repeatedly shown me together with the 2 most awesome dog-consultants, Tuffy and Poincaré. \
