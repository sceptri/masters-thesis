    abstract = {We derive two-point step sizes for the steepest-descent method by approximating the secant equation. At the cost of storage of an extra iterate and gradient, these algorithms achieve better performance and cheaper computation than the classical steepest-descent method. We indicate a convergence analysis of the method in the two-dimensional quadratic case. The behaviour is highly remarkable and the analysis entirely nonstandard.},

    abstract = {In this paper, a theory for synchronization of multiple dynamical systems under specific constraints is developed from a theory of discontinuous dynamical systems. The concepts on synchronization of two or more dynamical systems to specific constraints are presented. The synchronization, desynchronization and penetration of multiple dynamical systems to multiple specified constraints are discussed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for such synchronicity are developed. The synchronicity of two dynamical systems to a single specific constraint and to multiple specific constraints is investigated. Finally, the synchronization and the corresponding complexity for multiple slave systems with multiple master systems are discussed briefly. The meaning of synchronization for dynamical systems with constraints is extended as a generalized, universal concept. The theory presented in this paper may be as a universal theory for dynamical systems. The paper provides a theoretic frame work in order to control slave systems which can be synchronized with master systems through specific constraints in a general sense.},
